    Just launched a new website for Ecovative. Itâ€™s an e-commerce site called <a href="https://everythinghomegrown.com/" class="dim red">Everything Home Grown</a>. It was built using <a href="https://www.shopify.com/?ref=delight-consulting" class="dim red">Shopify</a>. Hey Shopify, I love you ðŸ’–.

    <a href="https://vaitech.io/" class="dim red">Vai Technologiesâ€™</a> new website is now live. They are a boutique consulting firm that builds artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. Check out their new website <a href="https://vaitech.io/" class="dim red">here</a>.

    I started playing around with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" class="dim red">Rasberry Pi</a> (itâ€™s a tiny computer). My first project was the <a href="{{ '/fish' | prepend: site.github.url }}" class="dim red">/fish page</a>. The Rasberry Pi reads the temperature from a sensor in the fish tank. Then it sends that data to the <a href="{{ '/fish' | prepend: site.github.url }}" class="dim red">/fish page</a>, updating once a minute.

    Up next, Iâ€™m going to automate the light schedule. Right now the fish wake up and fall asleep along with my sporadic sleep schedule. It canâ€™t be healthy for them.

    As for the more important parts of my life a.k.a. my Netflix viewing...I just finished rewatching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUid3tV1pro" class="dim red">Itâ€™s Always Sunny</a>. Now Iâ€™m watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrLZgP-OR6s" class="dim red">Parks and Recreation</a> again.
