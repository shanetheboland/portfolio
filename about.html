  <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">
    I was born and raised in Upstate New York. I live in a small house in the woods and <strong>I make things for the Internet</strong>. It’s quiet here and I never really have to wear pants.
  </p>


  <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy">
    I make my living as a front-end web designer. I design and code the parts of the Internet that you see and interact with.
  </p>

  <p class="f4 f3-ns measure lh-copy mb5">
    I believe the Internet should be fast, inexpensive and accessible to all. To help out with that cause, I strive to build websites that are fast, responsive, accessible, and content-focused.
