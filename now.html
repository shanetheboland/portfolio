    I bought a 35-gallon aquarium off Craigslist. It is now home to 3 bala sharks, a red-tailed shark, and a long-finned blushing white tetra. They seem to enjoy living here. I also bought 3 African Dwarf Frogs. They were named Fish, Frog, and Champagne Papi. They all died in less than a week.

    Still learning how to build things using React.js and Redux. I believe the best way to learn a new technology is to just shut up and build something. So I am building a simple little application called <a class="dim gold" href="https://github.com/shanetheboland/lemonade">Lemonade</a> that tracks how often I pee. Wow, I bet you didn’t see that coming.

    At Delight, we just finished up building the <a href="http://interiors.ecovativedesign.com" class="dim gold">Ecovative Interiors</a> microsite. We’re working on a project for <a href="http://www.tsladventures.net/" class="dim gold">TSL</a>, and maintaining <a href="http://www.ecovativedesign.com/" class="dim gold">Ecovative’s website</a> and ERP system.

    I’m writing in my notebook everyday, even if it’s only one sentence. I’m really starting to enjoy it. Blog posts coming soon once my writing is less terrible.
