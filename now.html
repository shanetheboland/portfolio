        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">I am learning how to build things using React.js and Redux. I believe the best way to learn a new technology is to just shut up and build something. So I am building a simple little application called <a class="dim gold" href="https://github.com/shanetheboland/lemonade">Lemonade</a> that tracks how often I pee. Wow, I bet you didn’t see that coming.</p>
      
        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">At Delight, we’re working on making a <a class="dim gold" href="http://delightagency.io">ticketing system</a> to help create smoother communication between agencies and their clients. The ticketing system is being built with React and Redux. We’re also working on a project for <a href="http://www.tsladventures.net/" class="dim gold">TSL</a>, and maintaining <a href="http://www.ecovativedesign.com/" class="dim gold">Ecovative’s website</a> and ERP system.</p>
      
        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">In my free time, I’m working on redesigning shaneboland.com. I’m also working on building a <a href="https://github.com/delightconsulting/delight-front-end-framework" class="dim gold">front-end framework</a> that will help me design websites faster.</p>
      
        <p class="f5 f4-ns measure lh-copy">I’m writing everyday, even if it’s only one sentence. I’m really starting to enjoy it. I didn’t think writing would be this fun. Blog posts coming soon once my writing is less terrible.</p>
